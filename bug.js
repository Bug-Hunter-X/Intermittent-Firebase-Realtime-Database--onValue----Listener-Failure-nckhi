In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't updating in real-time using the `onValue()` method.  The data would change in the Firebase console, but the UI wouldn't reflect these changes until a page refresh.  The `onValue()` listener was correctly attached, and the data structure was consistent. The issue was intermittent, making debugging difficult. The problem seemed related to how the data was being fetched, but not exactly clear how to resolve it.
